# Password Generator

A command-line tool that generates unique passwords based on input files (images, videos, or any other files).

## Installation

There are two ways to install this password generator:

### 1. From Release (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ak47andrew/password-generator/releases) page
2. Download the appropriate executable for your system:
   - `passwgen` for Linux
   - `passwgen.exe` for Windows
3. Place the executable in your desired location
4. (Optional) Add the executable location to your system PATH for easier access

### 2. From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ak47andrew/password-generator.git
cd password-generator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The password generator can be used with either local files or files from URLs.

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
# If installed from release:
passwgen --path <path_to_file> --length <password_length>

# If running from source:
python src/passwgen.py --path <path_to_file> --length <password_length>
```

### Options

- `--path`: Path to the input file or folder
- `--uri`: URL of the file to download and use
- `--length`: Desired password length (default: 20)
- `--silent`: Run in silent mode with minimal output

### Examples

1. Generate password from a local image:
```bash
passwgen --path image.jpg --length 25
```

2. Generate password from a URL:
```bash
passwgen --uri https://example.com/image.png --length 30
```

3. Generate password from a folder:
```bash
passwgen --path /path/to/folder --length 20
```

### Supported File Types

The generator has special handling for the following file types:
- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.webp`
- Videos: `.mov`, `.mp4`

Any other file type will be processed using the default method.

## Note

- When using the `--uri` option, the file will be downloaded temporarily and automatically deleted after password generation
- When using folders, all files in the folder (and subfolders) will be processed
- The minimum password length is 1, but longer passwords are recommended for security
